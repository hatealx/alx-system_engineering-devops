A firewall is a security system that can be either hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both. It's designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet, helping to prevent unauthorized access and protecting against potential cyber threats.
